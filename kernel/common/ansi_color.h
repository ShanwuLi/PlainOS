/*************************************************************************************
 * NOTE:
 *    ANSI escape codes are a standard for in-band signaling to control the cursor
 * location, color, and other options on text terminals. The ANSI x3.64 standard
 * was released in 1979 and later updated by the 5th edition ECMA-48 standard in 1991,
 * ISO/IEC 6429 in 1992, and ISO-8613-3 in 1995.
 *    ANSI escape codes are started using \e[ and contain numeric codes separated by
 * semicolons. The escape code is terminated with an 'm'.
